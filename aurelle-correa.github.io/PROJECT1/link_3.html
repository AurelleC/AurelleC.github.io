        <h2> Being in the field of engineering, it is expected that we should really be good in knowing all the terms specifically in our field. But the good news is that, there are tons of recources you can access to understand a specific topic if you could not understand what the professor had taught you in the class.</h2>
        
    <p> so here are some tips you could use to maximize your recources.</p>
        
<li> ACCESS THE BOOKS THAT IS USED BY YOUR PROFESSORS (FOUND IN SYLLABUS) </li>
        
        
        <p> DLSU follows a trimestral system not like the semestral sytem that can be found in almost all universities here in the Philippines. And having said of that fact, it is really expected that all of the lessons are in a fast pace (that is completely different from high school). So professors sometimes teach very fast that some students cannot cope up anymore. That  is why it is very useful to study the book when you got home, since most of the professors follow the syllabus and even the examples and problems in the book. </p>
        
<br>
        <li> WATCH EDUCATIONAL MATH VIDEOS</li>
        
        <p> It is also important that one must understand the lessons visually, that is why videos, mostly found in Youtube, are very helpful when one should visually see how this solution came up from this to this. Even when you can not understand the lessons from your professors, video tutorials are really handy as those videos have the lessons from the very basics up until the complicated ones. I would like to mention some video websites that really helped me a lot to understand topics in engineering up until now; and that is Khan Academy, Patrick Jmt, Math bff, and Organic Chemistry Tutorials. </p>
        
<br>
        
        <li>  ASK THE PEOPLE AROUND UNIVERSITY</li>
        
        <p> Use your charm in interacting with a lot of people and also to ask them with regards to engineering subject. In this way, you could also initiate a group study with your friends. As a freshman, you could also inquire to your upperclassmen to also ask for advices as a freshman; they would surely give a lot of advice since they've been also through your stage. </p>

        <p> Using the proper recourses will surely develop your study habit and even socializing with other people as you need to interact with them to acquire many important things in engineering. </p>
