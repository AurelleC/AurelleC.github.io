        <h2> You are now a step away in getting the diploma and degree that you've worked out  in your entire years of study; you're now officially a college student! But wait! Being one step away does not mean an easy step, college is a huge mountain you should conquer. A lot of hardwork, patience, perseverance, and many more must one attain in order to conquer this mountain. </h2>
        
        
            
    <p>
            So here are some methods you could do to pass college (and this also requires CONSISTENCY)  </p>
        <br>
        
        
<li> SET A PROPER TIME TABLE </li>
    <p>     This may sound so boring but this is really effective especially once this was done properly. Create a clear schedule of what time you should study for this subject, do this assignment for this subject, and even the time you will eat and target time you should sleep. If you start practicing that kind of habit, it will become a natural habit for you in the coming days so this is a really good practice to do. (WARNING: The number one enemy of this kind of routine is PROCRASTINATION. once you start diverting yourself to other things, your good habit of studying might break).
        </p>
        <br>
        
<li> PRIORITIZE WHAT YOU SHOULD STUDY </li>
    <p> As a college student, it is expected for all of us to have many subjects to take in one term. Most professors (not all) think that their subject is the most important subject you should take so they will not give consideration even though you need to prioritize other subjects first. Therefore it is really vital for you to be flexible and study what you think, you should really study. Always be mindful of what steps you must do accordingly to fulfill the requirements that you should do. </p>
        
<li> AFTER STUDYING, PRACTICE </li>
        <p>
         So for the last step, this applies especially for Math subjects. It is important most especially for engineering students to practice solving problems. It is proven and already tested by all of the students that one can not just pass by simple staring and understanding the problems and solutions. One must really practice solving problems personally so he knows by himself how to approach a certain mathematical problem. </p>

<p> After consistently following those simple yet challenging methods, you should really expect a good result in your examinations and academic activities</p>
